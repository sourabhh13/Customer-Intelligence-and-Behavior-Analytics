## Business Problem  

A retail company wants to better understand how customers interact with products, pricing, promotions, and subscription models. Management is interested in identifying the key drivers of purchasing behavior and repeat purchases so they can improve customer engagement, optimize marketing strategies, and increase long-term revenue.

## Dataset  

The dataset contains 3,900 customer purchase records across multiple product categories. It includes customer demographics, purchase details, discount and subscription information, review ratings, and shipping preferences.

## Tools and Technologies  

Python (Pandas, NumPy) was used for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis.  
PostgreSQL was used to run business-focused SQL queries on the cleaned data.  
Power BI was used to build an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends.

## Project Workflow  

1. The raw dataset was loaded and cleaned using Python.  
2. Missing values were handled and new analytical features such as age groups and purchase frequency were created.  
3. The cleaned dataset was loaded into a SQL database.  
4. SQL queries were written to analyze revenue, customer segments, product performance, discounts, and subscriptions.  
5. Power BI was connected to the database to create an interactive dashboard.  
6. A business report was prepared summarizing insights and recommendations.
